# My Blog Project

This project is a simple blog application built with the Flask framework, allowing users to create and manage posts in a straightforward, user-friendly environment. The app includes essential CRUD operations, so users can register, log in, create blog entries, view them on the main page, and delete their posts. User authentication secures account access, with password hashing for added security.

A local SQLite database stores user credentials and blog posts, keeping the setup lightweight and ideal for local deployment. Basic CSS styling enhances usability, ensuring a clean, organized layout. Visual feedback, such as success messages on login or deletion, helps users interact smoothly with the app.
